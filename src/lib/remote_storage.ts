/**
 * Usage notes
 *
 * Remote storage stores data on the server and is synchronized to all other
 * devices for the currently logged in player.
 *
 * Set will immediately update our local copy of the key and send the update to
 * the server which will then sychronize to other devices pretty quickly.
 *
 * Get will immediately return the local copy of our key, and relies on our
 * synchronzation system to take care of updating our local copy so it's ready
 * when we need it.
 *
 * Remove will immediately remove our local copy of the key and clear the value
 * from other devices.
 *
 * Remote storage only returns meaningful values when the user is authenticated,
 * otherwise all gets will return undefined.
 *
 *
 * KNOWN BUGS:
 *
 *   Right now we set our local state so we can access it immediately, however
 *   if the send doesn't happen correctly we can end up with clients being out
 *   of sync with one client having the local state set but the remote storage
 *   having never received that data. I think we *do* want the local set to happen
 *   immediately for UI convenience, which means I think the item on the TODO to
 *   fix this is to have persistent queue for sets and removes that gets retried
 *   when we reconnect to the server.
